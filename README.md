# Sea Ice Concentration Processing
 Files for processing and calculating sea ice concentration from CS2 and PMV

# Info
The CryoSat-2 (CS2) data files are processed according to the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling CryoSat-2 processing chain. See Tilling et al. (2018) 'Estimating Arctic sea ice thickness and volume using CryoSat-2 radar altimeter data' for details. The data are downloaded as along-track and gridded onto a 25 km grid.
The passive microwave (PMV) data files are from the NSIDC Team Algorithm, generating using passive microwave estimates of sea ice concentration. The data are already on a 25 km grid, but are regridded to the same grid as the CS2 data.
